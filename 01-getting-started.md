## What is Leanpub?
Leanpub is an online book publishing service that makes it easy for you to write, publish, and sell ebooks. Leanpub does way more than just generate ebooks but mentioning all you can do here might be confusing, instead I am going to show you the exact process I use, from start to sold. 

## Creating your first ebook

Now you will create your ebook following an easy three-step process that includes signing up for your Leanpub account.

Click [here](https://leanpub.com/create/book) to open the Leanpub "Create a Book or Course" page. This will open up the following page with three sections to complete:

From the getting started page, you can click on the first link on the page that will take you straight to the in-browser text editor where you can start writing.

The first time you open up your book in the editor, you will find three example chapters that give you some tips on getting started.

# Publishing your ebook the easy way - Getting started with Leanpub

In the past few weeks, I have started working as an intern technical writer at a company called [Ritza](https://ritza.co) and I have gained some precious insight into the ebook publishing process. Being an easy process once you understand it, I thought to write an opinionated guide on how to publish your own book using the exact same process we use. 

In this article, we will cover the first part of the process: getting stared on Leanpub. 

More specifically we will:

1. Sign up for a Leanpub account.
2. Create a book on Leanpub

## What is Leanpub?
 Leanpub is an online ebook publishing service that empowers authors to write, publish, and sell ebooks effortlessly. Leanpub does way more than just generate an ebook, it allows you to: write a book, edit your book, generate ebooks in different formats, sell or distribute your book to readers while you are still writing it, and much more. It might sound a little daunting hearing about all these services however, we will be focussing only on creating and publishing an unbranded ebook. Should you be interested in more of the Leanpub services, you can read more [here](https:/Leanpub.com/authors) and if you would like a more in-depth guide on Leanpub you can check out their [manual](https:/Leanpub.com/manual/read).

## Registering a Leanpub account

Being in the business of making things easy, Leanpub has made the sign-up process painless. You can start creating your first book right away which will create an account automatically, or if you are used to creating an account first before doing anything else, Leanpub has thought of you too and included a straight forward sign up page [here](https:/Leanpub.com/sign_up)

We will go through the process of creating a book while signing up automatically. Please note that both ways to sign up are similar, they only appear in different locations.

## Creating your first ebook

From here, whether you have an existing account or not we will create your first ebook with Leanpub.

Firstly, click [here](https://leanpub.com/create/book) to open the Leanpub "Create a Book or Course" page. This should open up the following page with three sections to complete:

![**Image: 2** *Leanpub create a book page* ](https://i.ritzastatic.com/leanpub-guide/01-leanpub-getting-started/01-02-create-a-book.png)

In the first section you can enter the following details:

1. I'd like to create: Choose “A Book”.
2. Give your book a catchy title. (this can be changed later)
3. Choose an available URL for your book.
4. Choose the language your book will be written in.
5. You then have the option to choose a book theme and your options are: Business, Technical, Fiction and Custom (you need to be on a standard or pro plan to access the custom theme). You can choose any theme you like, the main difference is that of the page sizing and layout. You can read more on the differences [here](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/3691789-what-are-the-settings-for-each-of-the-different-book-themes#:~:text=Leanpub%20books%20currently%20have%20four,for%20books%20in%20these%20genres.).
6. Here you can choose where you want to write your book. With the free plan, you can choose between the Leanpub in-browser plain text editor or you can upload a prepopulated ebook for distribution. The third option, only available on a standard or pro plan, allows you to sync your book content from either Dropbox, GitHub, or Bitbucket. I will be doing a separate guide on how to set up a sync between Leanpub and GitHub at a later stage. For now, we will choose the "In your web browser" option to conclude the first section.

Secondly, you need to choose your plan. In this case, we will choose the free plan that allows us to write and generate up to 100 ebooks in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI formats, then publish and sell them on Leanpub. Here you can also see what the other two plans offer, should you need to make use of the other services, choose the appropriate plan here.

Lastly, enter your personal details for the automatic account creation. Note, if you already have an account you can simply click the sign-in button, or if you are already signed in, it will show your signed-in account and you can continue.

![**Image: 5** *Create a Book: Section 3* ](https://i.ritzastatic.com/leanpub-guide/01-leanpub-getting-started/01-05-signup-sect3.png)

Once you have completed all the fields, accept the terms and conditions, and click on the "sign up" or "add to plan" button. This will create the base of your ebook and open up a "getting started" page that has a lot more information on getting started and using the Markdown language.

![**Image: 6** *Getting started page* ](https://i.ritzastatic.com/leanpub-guide/01-leanpub-getting-started/01-06-getting-started-page.png)

From the getting started page, you can open up a quick getting started tutorial on how to use the in-browser plain text editor or you can click on the very first link on the page that will take you straight to the in-browser text editor where you can start writing.

The first time you open up your book in the editor, you will find three example chapters that will help you get started on writing your book as soon as possible.

You have now set up your Leanpub account and created your first ebook. For now you can start adding content to your book using what you have learned and by making use of the Leanpub [manual](https:/Leanpub.com/manual/read). In the next part of this guide I will show you how to write in the In-Browser Editor using Markown, and how to generate your first preview.

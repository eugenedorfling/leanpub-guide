### Designing and Uploading your Book Cover

From here you have the option to design your cover from scratch, however, for this guide we will choose one of the many existing templates.

In the searchbox, top left, type in a phrase that matches what your book is about. From the templates that come up below, choose one that you like and select it. The template will be applied and you can then start editing the template to fit your design needs.

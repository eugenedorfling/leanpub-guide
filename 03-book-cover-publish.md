# Part 3 - Creating a Book Cover and Publishing

In this section, you will be designing the front cover of your book, upload it to Leanpub, and then publish your book on the Leanpub Book store. You'll use Canva, which is a free and simple online design tool that includes templates for book covers.

More specifically you will:

1. Create a Canva account 
2. Design the cover of your book
3. Upload your cover to Leanpub
4. Publish your ebook on the Leanpub store

## Creating a Canva account

Click [here](https://www.canva.com/create/book-covers/) to navigate to the Canva Book Cover Maker and click on the button called "Start Designing Your Book Cover"

## Designing and Uploading your Book Cover

From here you have the option to design your cover from scratch, however, the pre-existing templates are plenty to choose from and are fully customizable so I will be using a template in this example.

In the search box, top left, type in a phrase that matches what your book is about. From the templates that come up below, choose one that you like and select it. The template will be applied and you can then start editing the template to fit your design needs.

![**Image: 5** *Choose Template*](https://i.ritzastatic.com/leanpub-guide/03-book-cover-publish/03-05-cover-template.png)

You can double click elements on the template to edit them, right-click for more options and select new elements from the left toolbar to customize your cover design.

Once you are happy with the design of your cover, click on the download button in the top right corner. From the dropdown menu select the PNG file type. Select a download location and click on save to start the download. *Note: Leanpub only supports PNG and JPEG of which JPEG is lower quality*

When your download is complete, go back to the Leanpub platform and from the "Books" menu navigate to "YourBookTitle", "Settings" and then select "Upload Book Cover" as seen below:

Scroll down to below the current default cover page and click on the "Choose File" button. From the file browser pop up, navigate to the cover that you downloaded from Canva, select it, and click "Open". Now click on the "Update Book Cover" button and your cover will start uploading.

Now that your book has content and a beautiful cover image we can proceed to publish your book on the Leanpub store to start selling.

## Publishing your book on the Leanpub Book Store

Before you can publish your book on the Leanpub store, there are a few last steps you need to complete that will help with the marketing of your book.

The steps we will look at are:

1. Setting the price.
2. Completing the "About the Book" section and writing some teaser text.
3. Adding some categories.

### Set the Price 

Leanpub uses a variable pricing model that allows authors to set a minimum price and a suggested one, this encourages the readers to pay a little more while giving them the option to choose what they can afford.

By default, your book has a minimum price of US$4.99 and a suggested US$9.99, however, for this guide, we will be generous and make it a free book.

Open the "Pricing" page by navigating to "Store" under your book in the "Books" menu as seen below:

![Image: 10 Price menu](https://i.ritzastatic.com/leanpub-guide/03-book-cover-publish/03-10-lp-price-menu.png)

Enter the minimum book price of $0 and a suggested book price of $0, then scroll down and click on the "Update Pricing" button. You should see a confirmation message saying "Pricing updated".

### Complete the "About the Book" Section
